# PSStringThing - An add function over strings of numbers in PostScript

PostScript implementation of a function that adds numbers listed in a string and returns the sum. Lack of unit testing frameworks resulted in me having to implement a tiny one myself, otherwise I couldn't develop the code using a test-first approach.

## Running the program

Getting the program to execute can vary depending on the operator. If you happen to be a printer...

### How to use if you are a printer
1. Read the code of `adds_tests.ps`
2. Success!

Otherwise...

### Run environment
* A human that likes to think backwards
* A computer with some PostScript interpreter (developed using Ghostscript)
